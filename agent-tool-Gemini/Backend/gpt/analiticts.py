            Guidelines:
            - The dataset may contain multiple fields.
            - The fields can be used to create different types of charts.
            - The output should include the type of chart and the fields that can be used to create it.
            - The output should be in JSON format.
            - The output should include at least two different combinations of fields and chart types.
            - The output should be based on the dataset provided.
