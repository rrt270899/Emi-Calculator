For technical failure, customer showed to be given three attempts to click the “Proceed” button.

If after 3rd attempt, again technical failure is received, then a generic error message should be shown to the customer stating “We cannot process your request. Please contact branch official for assistance.” (message to be kept configurable).

Post showing the error message, customer should be disallowed to proceed from that stage.

+_Handling for Functional Failure-_+

When MicrositeNetbankingAPI responds with value against the tag named “ISSUCCESS” as “True” but without the transaction call back URL, i.e., the tag named {{<transactionCompleteCallbackUrl>}} is returned as blank or is not present in the response, then same to be considered as functional failure.

In case of functional failure, SFDC should not allow customer to have any further attempts to proceed with the account aggregator process and should show a generic error message stating “We cannot process your request.

*Proposed:*

When a LAN where Account Aggregator process has been completed and is created in IFBL flow reaches the above-mentioned stage and sub-stage, then user is required to setup the disbursement details by either entering IFSC Code or MICR Code of the disbursement account.

A validation should be built on the “Next” button available on the UI at the above-mentioned stage and sub-stage such that SFDC is able to validate the IFSC or MICR code entered by the user in this stage and sub-stage with the ones received in the Inbound API (SVC Name - INBOUND_PERFIOS_BANKING) response.

!image-20240705-102852.png|width=1539,height=724,alt=""image-20240705-102852.png""!

The IFSC and MICR code received in the Inbound API (SVC Name - INBOUND_PERFIOS_BANKING) response are stamped against the fields named “IFSC Code” and “MICR Code” respectively as mentioned in [[ML-47121] Stamping of IFSC Code and MICR Code in Perfios Banking Details Object - Jira (atlassian.net)|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-47121].

+_Logic for application of the said Validation-_+

* In the above-mentioned stage and sub-stage if the user enters IFSC code details for verification of the disbursement account, then SFDC should refer the value stamped against the field named “IFSC Code” available in Perfios Bank Details object.
** If the value entered by the user matches with the value stamped against the field named “IFSC Code”, then the user should be allowed to proceed as per process by clicking the “Next” button (as highlighted in red on above screenshot) available on the UI
** If the value entered by the user does not match with the value stamped against the field named “IFSC Code”, then upon clicking of “Next” button (as highlighted in red on above screenshot) SFDC should show an error toast message to the user stating, “Please use the same account as done in Account Aggregator process” (toast message to be kept configurable) and SFDC should not allow the user to proceed into next stage
*** Post showing the error toast message, user should be able to change the bank account & IFSC code details and proceed by again clicking the “Next” button (above-mentioned validation should be applied whenever user clicks on the “Next” button) available on UI
* In the above-mentioned stage and sub-stage if the user enters MICR code details for verification of the disbursement account, then SFDC should refer the value stamped against the field named “MICR Code” available in Perfios Bank Details object.
** If the value entered by the user matches with the value stamped against the field named “MICR Code”, then the user should be allowed to proceed as per process by clicking the “Next” button (as highlighted in red on above screenshot) available on the UI
** If the value entered by the user does not match with the value stamped against the field named “MICR Code”, then upon clicking of “Next” button (as highlighted in red on above screenshot) SFDC should show an error toast message to the user stating, “Please use the same account as done in Account Aggregator process” (toast message to be kept configurable) and SFDC should not allow the user to proceed into next stage
*** Post showing the error toast message, user should be able to change the bank account & MICR code details and proceed by again clicking the “Next” button (above-mentioned validation should be applied whenever user clicks on the “Next” button) available on UI","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when an IFBL LAN where Account Aggregator process has been completed successfully and has reached sanction stage and disbursement details pending sub-stage, then SFDC should be able to validate the IFSC or MICR code entered by the user for the disbursement account is same as the one received against Inbound API (SVC Name - INBOUND_PERFIOS_BANKING) response

This was because, in Office Address section of such base loans the “Copy Address Form” field was enabled for user in the form of drop down and users were able to select either permanent or residence address details to populate the office address related fields.

# New field to be created in Applicant record called “Aadhar validation attempt” 
# Default value of Aadhar validation attempt field to be kept as 0
# When User clicks on Validate Aadhar button, Aadhar validation attempt should be counted 
# When ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYC NSDL Authentication API fail as mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-44360|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-44360|smart-link] & [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-44779|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-44779|smart-link] then User should be provided 3 attempts before being allowed to proceed to the next screen
# When ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthentication API fail for first 2 times error toast message to be displayed to the User “Aadhar Validation Failed, Please re-attempt Aadhar Validation” (Toast message to be kept configurable)
# When ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthenticatoin API fails the 3rd time then error toast message to be displayed to the User “Something went wrong-Please proceed without Aadhar Validation” and Aadhar linked with Mobile field should be stamped as False
# When ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthenticatoin API responds successfully, then user should be shown a toast message stating “Aadhar Validation done successfully. Please proceed with the same.” (message content to be kept configurable)
# When ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthenticatoin API responds with functional failure, then user should be shown a toast message stating “Aadhar cannot be validated. Please proceed without aadhar validation.” (message content to be kept configurable)

Note: In case of Technical Failure scenario, User should be allowed to Proceed from Applicant Detail Entry screen only if the User has attempted Aadhar Validation for 3 times and in the 3rd attempt as well ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthentication API have faced technical failure

# New field named “Aadhar Mobile linkage technical failure” to be created in Applicant record. In case the user exhausts the 3 attempts and ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthentication API still responds with technical failure, then the field named “Aadhar Mobile linkage technical failure” should be stamped as “True”. Post 3 attempts, the “Validate Aadhar” button should get disabled on the UI. In case if ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthentication API responds successfully in any attempt then “Aadhar Mobile linkage technical failure” field should be stamped as “False”
# In case ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYCNSDLAuthentication API responds with a functional failure, then the field named “Aadhar Linked with Mobile” should be stamped as “False” and user should not be provided any retry attempts in this scenario. In this scenario the “Validate Aadhar” button should get disabled after API responds with a functional failure
# After User clicks on Validate Aadhar button, system should display processing screen Until ADV_GETVALUE API and EKYC NSDL Authentication API respond successfully or error response is received from one of the APIs. 

*Note*: 

# If EKYC NSDL Authentication API fails then system upon click of Validate Aadhar button should trigger ADV_GENVALUE API again and post success of the API trigger EKYC NSDL Authentication API
# If ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYC NSDL Authentication API remains in progress for more than 2 minutes then system should be consider the same to be a technical failure and same handling as technical error should be extended
# In case ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYC NSDL Authentication API responds with a technical failure for 3 times, then user should be allowed to proceed by clicking the “Next” button
# In case ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYC NSDL Authentication API responds with a functional failure, then user should be allowed to proceed by clicking the “Next” button

*Stage:* Sanction

*Sub-stage :* New Account Opening Pending

*Proposed:*

If “Aadhar linked with Mobile” field is stamped as “True” and CBS_Searchcustomer_Attach API responds successfully with existing account details, then SFDC should compare the mobile number received from the above-mentioned API and the one entered by the user in the consent screen against the field named “Adhaar Linked Mobile Number” [[ML-44358] Consent screen UI changes for Aadhar Mob no linkage - Jira (atlassian.net)|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-44358] and handling to be made as per below mentioned scenarios:

+_Scenario 1-_+ 

*  If both the mobile numbers are same, then SFDC should allow the user to select the radio button available against this account number available on the UI.
** When user clicks on “Next” button available on UI, SFDC should allow user to proceed with existing account. If user does not select the radio button and clicks on next then User should be moved to Other account flow. 

+_Scenario 2-_+

* If both mobile numbers are different, then SFDC should show an error message to the user below the account fetched stating “IDFC Account not linked with Aadhar linked mobile number” (message content to be kept configurable) and shall keep the radio button available against the retrieved account number frozen such that user is not able to select the same. Upon click of Next button, the User should be directed to other account flow. 

*Note*: 

# If system receives 12 digit in the CBS search attach response, then system should not consider the 91 prefix and consider only the remaining 10 digits when comparing with aadhar linked mobile number. 
# If system receives 10 digits, then comparison to happen directly with aadhar linked mobile number

*N.B.* The build should be kept configurable, i.e., the switch on and switch off functionality to be added in this story","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the field named “Aadhar linked with Mobile” stamped as “True” and CBS_Searchcustomer_Attach API responds successfully with existing account details, then SFDC should be able to compare the mobile number received from the above-mentioned API and the one entered by the user in the consent screen against the field named “Aadhaar Linked Mobile Number” [[ML-44358] Consent screen UI changes for Aadhar Mob no linkage - Jira (atlassian.net)|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-44358] and below flow to proceed:

# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the field named “Aadhar linked with Mobile” stamped as “True” and CBS_Searchcustomer_Attach API responds successfully with existing account details, then SFDC should be able to compare the mobile number received from the above-mentioned API and the one entered by the user in the consent screen against the field named “Aadhaar Linked Mobile Number” [[ML-44358] Consent screen UI changes for Aadhar Mob no linkage - Jira (atlassian.net)|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-44358] and below flow to proceed:

# If ADV_GENVALUE API or EKYC NSDL Authentication API remains in progress for more than 2 minutes then system should be consider the same to be a technical failure and same handling as technical error should be extended
# Error codes to be kept configurable and maintained in metadata. 

Eg: 200 is defined as success error code now, if mule changes this to 300 later then we should be able to change it to 300 in our metadata and if 300 is passed in error code sfdc should treat it as success and accordingly Aadhaar mobile linkage field should be stamped and UI should display success toast message.  ","# Given that ADV_GETVALUE API responds successfully, system should trigger EKYC NSDL Authentication API with request as mentioned above
# Given that EKYC NSDL Authentication API in response returns code tag in resource data array as 200 then Aadhar linked with mobile field should be stamped as True 
## Validate Aadhar Button should be disabled to user after Aadhar linked with mobile field is stamped as True
# Given that EKYC NSDL Authentication API in response returns code tag in resource data array as 401 then Aadhar linked with mobile field should be stamped as False
# Given that EKYC NSDL Authentication API in response returns code tag in resource data array as any value other than 200 or 401 then system should consider it as API failure","

Below the field name “Aadhaar Linked Mobile Number”, user should be provided with a new field named “Device Type”.

User should be provided with two options i.e., “Android / I-phone” and “Featured Phone” respectively against the field named “Device Type”.

The options should be provided to the user in form of radio buttons.

Placement of this field should be as highlighted with red box in the below snapshot:

+_Validation to be built on “Send OTP” button: -_+

A validation to be built on “Send OTP” button such that before sending the OTP, SFDC should be able to validate that user has selected any one radio button option against the field named “Device Type”.

!image-20240530-065049.png|width=1600,height=540,alt=""image-20240530-065049.png""!

In case user has not selected any radio button option against the field named “Device Type” then SFDC should validate the same and show an error toast message to the user stating, “Please select relevant option against Device Type” (content for error message to be kept configurable).

Post showing the error toast message user should be allowed to select one of the radio button options against the field named “Device Type” and also, user should be able to edit the value against “Aadhaar Linked Mobile Number” field.

After making the modification (if any) and selecting one of the radio button options, then validation should be applied again on the field named “Get OTP” and user should be allowed to proceed as per process.

*Proposed:*

In Repeat Loans two fields named “Declare Total Annual Income (Excluding Agri Income)” and “Declare Total Agriculture Annual Income” to be available on the UI, when user clicks the “Form 60” check box available on the UI. The field should be available on the UI in the location highlighted as “red” box in below screenshot:

The field should be available only when user clicks on “Form 60” check box.

*Data Population Logic against the field named “Declare Total Annual Income” in Repeat Loans”:*

+_Scenario 1_+

In base loan, if an income value is already available against the fields named “Declare Total Annual Income” and “Declare Total Agriculture Annual Income” as per the requirement and validation mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-41007|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-41007|smart-link] and [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-46074|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-46074|smart-link] respectively, then same should be auto populated in editable format for repeat loan against the fields as mentioned above in “Applicant Detailed Entry” stage.

The user should be able to edit the value in case of any changes.

+_Scenario 2_+

In base loan, if there is no value against the field named “Declare Total Annual Income”and “Declare Total Agriculture Annual Income”, then in repeat loan the said fields should be available to the user as “blank” in “Applicant Detailed Entry” stage as mentioned above.

The user should be able to enter the value in numerical format against the said field.

*Current:*

As per current process when user selects “Yes” as an option from the dropdown available against field named “Loan Purpose Met” then mandatory field named “Proof of EUC” is made available to the user on the UI where user has to upload the proof of EUC document.

Other mandatory fields are available to the user on the EUC screen basis the logic defined in [[ML-11336] New fields to be created to capture URC details - Jira (atlassian.net)|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-11336].

*Proposed:*

The field named “Proof of EUC” should not be shown to the user on UI irrespective of the option selected by the user from the dropdown available against fields named “Loan Purpose Met” and “Eligible for URC” respectively.

Mandatory URC related fields to be available for the user on UI as per the revised logic mentioned below:

|*Loan Purpose Met*|*Eligible for URC*|*URC No.*|*URC Generation date*|*Upload URC Certificate*|
|No|No|Not visible|Not visible|Not visible|
|Yes|No|Not visible|Not visible|Not visible|
|Yes|Yes|Mandatory|Mandatory|Visible|

 *Field Visibility logic on UI:* 

When user lands on EUC screen, the user should be shown both “Loan Purpose Met” and “Eligible for URC” fields on the UI. 

However, only “Loan Purpose Met” field should be editable and “Eligible for URC” field should not be editable. 

In case user selects “Yes” as an option from the drop down against “Loan Purpose Met” field, the “Eligible for URC” field should become editable. 

When user selects “No” as an option from the dropdown available against field named “Loan Purpose Met”, then the field named “Eligible for URC” should be populated as “No” by default and user should not be able to edit the field named “Eligible for URC” without selecting the dropdown as “Yes” against the field named “Loan Purpose Met”.

*N.B.*

The “Submit” button should be enabled as per above grid and only if the mandatory inputs are entered by the user

*Note:*

# In case of CJ / Telecaller, the fields named “Eligible for URC” ;  “URC No.” and “URC Generation Date” should be auto populated from the base loan in editable format when the value against “Loan Purpose Met” field is marked as “Yes” in base loan
# In case these details are not available in base loan, then the fields should be available to the user on the UI as per the logic mentioned above and user should be able to fill the details
# In case of CJ / Telecaller, the fields named “URC No.” and “URC Generation Date” should not be shown to the user on UI when the “Loan Purpose Met” is selected as “No” in base loan. For this scenario, user should be shown “Loan Purpose Met” on UI pre-filled as “No” from base loan in editable form and as per above mentioned logic, “Eligible for URC” field should be populated as “No” in non-editable format, which can be edited once user selects “Yes” from drop down against “Loan Purpose Met” field","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when user reaches the EUC screen, then the field named “Proof of EUC” should not be available to the user on UI irrespective of the option selected by the user from the dropdown available against fields named “Loan Purpose Met” and “Eligible for URC” respectively

+Annual Income Field+ - 

A new field named “Annual Income” to be added against each income type at the “Income Details” section in the above-mentioned stage and sub-stage.

!image-20240429-110759.png|width=1418,height=288,alt=""image-20240429-110759.png""!

+_Logic for populating the “Annual Income” field against each Income Type:_+

The monthly income entered by the user should be multiplied by 12 and the calculated value should be auto-populated against the field named “Annual Income”.

This “Annual Income” value should be stamped in back end in the “Income Details” object against each income type record.

+Total Income Field+ -

A new field named “Total Income” to be added on the “Income Section” in the above-mentioned stage and sub-stage.

Reference UI provided below:

!image-20240429-111003.png|width=1295,height=458,alt=""image-20240429-111003.png""!

+_Logic for populating the “Total Income” field:_+

The “Total Income” field should be populated as sum total of “Annual Income” for all income types *except for Agricultural Income* which is calculated as per above mentioned logic.

This “Total Income” value should be stamped in back end within the applicant object.

+Examples:+

* For Business Income, user enters “Monthly Income” value against existing field as Rs 1000, then basis the above mentioned logic “Annual Income” should be 1000*12 = 12000
* For Household Income, user enters “Monthly Income” value against existing field as Rs 2000, then basis the above mentioned logic “Annual Income” should be 2000*12 = 24000
* For Dairy Income, user enters “Animal” as Buffalo ; “Breed” as Hybrid ; “No. of Animals” as 2 and “Income per Animal” gets populated as Rs 6840 basis existing logic, then the monthly income gets calculated to Rs 13680. Hence, basis the above mentioned logic “Annual Income” should be 13680*12 = 164160
* So, the “Total Income” should be calculated as  - 12000+24000+164160 = 200160 and accordingly this value should be populated against the field named “Total Income”

+Validation to be applied on Total Income Field+

A validation to be built on “Total Income” field, such that when the value against the said field obtained basis the above mentioned logic is more than 2,50,000 (to be kept configurable) then SFDC should show an error message to the user stating “For Form 60, Total Income should not be more than 2,50,000” (the message content to be kept configurable).

This validation to be applicable only when user has selected the “Form 60” radio button on the consent screen.

*Note:* Post showing the error message, if the user does not change the income value, then user should not be proceed to next stage by clicking the “Next” button available at the bottom of the UI.","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when user adds the income type in the “Income Details” section, then SFDC should show “Annual Income” field with value as per logic defined in description to the user
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when SFDC calculates the “Annual Income”, then basis the calculated annual income of each income type, SFDC should be able to calculate the “Total Income” and populate that value against the “Total Income” field on UI in the “Income Details” section

Handling for the “Check Status” button to be as per one of the below mentioned scenarios:

+_Scenario 1-_+

When TransStatusAPI has responded successfully, then SFDC should check the status of inbound response. If SFDC receives the inbound response successfully, then user should be re-directed to the Perfios screen where user should be able to view the “Banking” and “Banking Details” screen respectively and user should be allowed to proceed as per existing process.

+_Scenario 2 -_+

When TransStatusAPI responded with a failure or was not triggered initially, then when user clicks on “Check Status” button, SFDC should be able to identify the same and retrigger the TransStatusAPI again.

Post retriggering of TransStatusAPI: 

# If successful response is received, then SFDC should check the status of inbound response. When inbound response is received successfully, SFDC should re-direct the user to the Perfios screen where user should be able to view the “Banking” and “Banking Details” screen respectively as per existing process.
# When TransStatusAPI responds with a failure - _Handling 1_: If failure response is received, then SFDC should be able to identify the error value received against the tag named {{<Part errorCode=}}> 
## When TransStatus API responds with any one of the error values mentioned in the below chart against the tag named {{<Part errorCode=}}>, then SFDC should show the error toast message as provided in the said chart (all error toast messages provided in below chart to be kept configurable).
## Post showing the error toast message, “Check Status” button should get disabled and SFDC should mark the earlier link as expired and allow user to select bank name and send new link to the customer
## In this scenario, if user selects the same bank name as earlier, then SFDC should again create a new bank record with the same bank’s name in Perfios Bank Details object and allow the user to proceed as per process

Post showing the error message, “Check Status” button should be replaced with “Retry” button on the UI and all other buttons should be disabled on the UI.

User should be provided with three attempts to click the retry button as per the logic mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26004|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26004|smart-link].

After clicking the “Retry” button, if inbound response is received successfully, then SFDC should re-direct the user to the Perfios screen where user should be able to view the “Banking” and “Banking Details” screen respectively.

If user exhausts the three attempts to click the “Retry” button, then user should be shown an error message stating “Account Aggregator process cannot be completed successfully” (message to be kept configurable) and user should be re-directed to the Perfios screen.

In such scenario, at backend field named “AA_Data_Fetch_Done__c” to be stamped as “False”.

Once user is re-directed to the Perfios screen, user should be allowed to proceed with any of the three options i.e., Account Aggregator, E-Statement or Scanned Statement as per process.","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when TransStatusAPI has responded successfully, then SFDC should check the status of inbound response and if inbound response is received successfully, then user should be re-directed to the Perfios screen where user should be able to view the “Banking” and “Banking Details” screen respectively and user should be allowed to proceed as per existing process
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when TransStatusAPI responded with a failure or was not triggered initially, then when user clicks on “Check Status” button, SFDC should be able to identify the same and retrigger the TransStatusAPI again and post re-triggering the said API:
## If successful response is received, then SFDC should check the status of inbound response. When inbound response is received successfully, SFDC should re-direct the user to the Perfios screen where user should be able to view the “Banking” and “Banking Details” screen respectively and user should be allowed to proceed as per existing process
## If failure response is received, then SFDC should proceed as per the two handlings mentioned in description (under scenario 2) and show an error toast message to the user basis the chart mentioned in the description. The error would be received in the response against the tag named {{<Part errorCode=}}>

*Business Case:*

In case a LAN is created post Perfios build is deployed then Perfios stage should only be applicable to such LANs and not for LANs which were created prior to deployment of Perfios.

*Proposed:*

A validation to be built in SFDC that can compare the LAN creation date and the date on which Perfios is made applicable for all schemes.

Basis this validation, Perfios stage and its subsequent logics should only be applicable for cases where LAN creation date is post Perfios deployment date.

For cases where LAN creation date is prior to Perfios deployment date, then in such cases Perfios stage should not be applicable.

In such cases Perfios Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23825|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23825|smart-link] & [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|smart-link] and the subsequent logics [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25015|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25015|smart-link] should not be applicable.

For LANs which have been re-triggered from Data Verification, Underwriting or DVOps stage and have LAN creation date prior to Perfios Deployment Date, then Perfios should not be made applicable in such scenario basis the validation mentioned above.

Similarly, for LANs which are currently in Applicant Detailed Entry stage and were created prior to Perfios deployment, then Perfios will not be applicable for such cases as well.

Any case where LAN creation date is post Perfios deployment date, then in such cases Perfios will be applicable as per the logics defined in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25015|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25015|smart-link] irrespective of stage and sub-stage of that case. ","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when Perfios is made applicable for all schemes, then SFDC should be able to validate the LAN creation date and Perfios deployment date.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when LAN creation date is prior to Perfios deployment date, then Perfios related screen and logics should not be applicable for such cases.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when a case is retriggered from Data Verification, Underwriting or DVOps stage post deploying Perfios, then SFDC should be able to apply the validation as mentioned in description and Perfios should not be applicable for such cases.

Once the user is able to identify the offer in SFDC, the request for top up MEL loan is processed by the user in the SFDC. 

*Proposed:*

When user clicks on the “Offer” button from CRM, then SSO should get triggered through Azzure.

Basis the Unique ID i.e., the Associated Offer ID available against the customer, user upon clicking the “Offer” button should land on the loan application screen or DDE screen through the SSO.

{color:#006644}Placeholders to be named as “KYC Document (POI / POA)” and “Bank Statement Document”{color}

New “Hold” buttons to be made available next to POI/POA and Bank Statement for DVOps user UI.

{color:#006644}Once the user reaches the DVOps stage, the DVOps user should be able to view these new documents.{color}

{color:#006644}A “Hold” button to be available next to these documents in the DVOps stage such that when the user clicks on the “Hold” button, the case is put on hold for sales user to re-upload the said documents.{color}

DVOps user should be able to put the new discrepant non-adb docs on hold and enter hold comments/remarks. 

{color:#006644}Upon clicking on the “Hold” button, DVOps user should mandatorily be allowed to enter the remarks for holding the document. {color}

Sales user should be able to view the comments/remarks at Hold-Doc Verification stage (Document Upload 2  screen). 

Sales user should upload new document mandatorily  if DVOps user has returned case due to Hold on KYC Doc or Bank Statement doc.

*Proposed:* 

* In case of MEL Repeat Loans, the final income which is considered for eligibility in base loan should flow to the repeat loan as well.
* The BCM user should have the rights to edit/modify the base loan income and changes should only be applicable exclusively to Repeat Loan and not on Base Loan.
* The income value passed to FICO should be a summation of income added by IRO user; income added by BCM user and income received from Base Loan in case PD case is not generated for MEL Repeat loan. *Value flowing to FICO should match with CAM report and Income details available in underwriting page in UI.*
* In case PD Income is available in the Repeat Loan then logic should work As-Is, i.e., IRO / Base Loan income to be overridden by PD Income.
* The final come which is considered for eligibility in base loan should flow to repeat loan and the value stamped in “Income Details” object at the back end in Repeat Loan.
* Similarly the new income added by IRO or BCM user should be stamped in “Income Details” object at the back end in Repeat Loan.
* In case if PD income is available in Repeat Loan same should be stamped in PD Income Detail object in back end.
* UI handling to be As-Is.
* In case there is a PD income, then value against “Total Income of App/Co-App” field to be replaced with the value received in PD Income and same to be used for Incremental Cash flow calculation.","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when MEL Repeat Loans are created, then the final income which is considered for eligibility in base loan should flow to the repeat loan as well.

# Given that mentioned changes are done, when BCM edits/modifies the income of Base Loan, then the changes should only be replicated in Repeat Loan and not in base loan.

*Proposed:* Following handling should be done for various retriggered scenarios -

+Pre Perfios Stage - Employment and Loan & Product Stage:-+

As-Is process to be followed i.e., on retriggering from the above mentioned stages user will land on applicant detailed entry stage and follow the current process. 

+Post Perfios Stage - Data Verification; Underwriting and DvOps Stage:-+

In case the loan is retriggered from any of the above mentioned stages user will land on the applicant detailed entry stage and following logics to be applied across various scenarios:

+_Scenario 1_+ - For a Perfios mandatory retriggered case, if the user does not make any changes to the existing data {color:#bf2600}which is impacting the Perfios Master Logic {color}[https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|smart-link] in the applicant detailed entry {color:#bf2600}or Employment{color} stage then at Perfios stage, user should be allowed to proceed without reinitiating the Perfios process and details entered prior to retriggering in the Perfios stage would remain As-Is.

In such cases, a “Next” button to be available on the Perfios Screen UI on clicking which the user will be allowed to proceed ahead without reinitiating the Perfios process. 

+_Scenario 2_+ - For a Perfios optional retriggered case, if the user does not make any changes to the existing data {color:#bf2600}which is impacting the Perfios Master Logic {color}[https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|smart-link] in the applicant detailed entry {color:#bf2600}or Employment{color} stage then at Perfios stage, user should be allowed to proceed ahead by clicking on the existing “Skip and Proceed” button available on the UI.

+_Scenario 3_+ - For a Perfios optional retriggered case, if the user makes any changes to the existing data like Scheme, Loan Amount, applicant employment type, Salary Mode, Employed With, etc., then as per the logic defined in Perfios Master [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|smart-link], the case will be determined to be Perfios Mandatory or Perfios Optional. 

In case basis the new details entered if the case is identified to be Perfios Mandatory then user should mandatorily complete the entire Perfios process from the Perfios Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|smart-link]. 

In case basis the new details entered if the case is identified to be Perfios Optional then user should be allowed to proceed by clicking the “Skip and Proceed” button from the Perfios Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|smart-link].

+_Scenario 4_+ - For either Perfios Mandatory or Optional retriggered case, if a new co-applicant is added post retriggering then Perfios logic based on Perfios Master [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|smart-link] will be applicable to the co-applicant as well and the user post identifying the co-applicant to be Perfios Mandatory or Optional shall follow the as-is process applicable in Perfios Stage.

In such scenarios, post retriggering if Perfios is applicable only for identified applicants then Perfios process should be initiated for the identified applicant only.

For instance - In case of Perfios mandatory retriggered case, if no changes are done for the existing applicants and only new applicants are added, then basis the logic of Perfios Master [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|smart-link] if the newly added applicant is identified as Perfios Mandatory then Perfios to be initiated for that applicant only and not for other applicants.

+_Scenario 5 retriggering from Perfios Screen_+ -

Introduce retrigger button at the Perfios Screen below the cards.

Upon clicking on this retrigger button, user will land on the applicant data entry stage where if the user does not make any changes to the existing data, then the user will be allowed to proceed as per the as-is flow.

If there is any changes done to the existing data then basis the logic identified from Perfios Master [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23828|smart-link] user will be allowed to proceed the case as Perfios Mandatory or Optional as per the scenarios defined above.","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user retriggers a case prior reaching the Perfios stage, then user should land on Applicant Detailed Entry stage.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user retriggers a case post the Perfios stage, i.e., from Data Verification, Underwriting and DvOps stage respectively then the scenarios to be handled as mentioned in description.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user retriggers a cast from the Perfios screen, then the scenarios to be handled as mentioned in description. ","Apex

*Proposed:* Once API 3 responds successfully [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|smart-link] and the fields on Banking Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|smart-link] and Banking Details Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|smart-link] are populated basis the logic defined in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|smart-link] then the user should be provided with an additional “Reset” button on UI as shown in below snapshot:

!image-20240221-121408.png|width=696,height=339!

Upon clicking the “Reset” button, user should be shown a pop up with the following message:

“{color:#ff5630}*Warning*{color}*: By clicking on ""*{color:#ff5630}*Reset*{color}*,"" you will be redirected to the Perfios screen to start Perfios activities anew.*

*Do you want to continue?*” 

The pop up should also have “yes” and “No” buttons respectively.

Upon clicking the “Yes” button user would be redirected to Perfios Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23825|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-23825|smart-link] and [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24526|smart-link].

Once the user lands on the Perfios screen, then the cards available on the screen should be clickable and user should be allowed to proceed as per process by clicking on any of the cards.

In case the user clicks on the “No” button, user will have to proceed to the next stage by clicking on the “Next” button as mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|smart-link]

# The user post landing on the Perfios Screen by clicking the “Reset” button proceeds with either “E-Statement” or “Scanned Statement” options and selects the same bank name as done earlier from the available options then the earlier values stamped as per the logic defined in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24871|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24871|smart-link] -to- should not be overwritten with the new values derived from the new statement uploaded by applying the logics mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24871|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24871|smart-link] and a separate bank record to be created in back end to save details.","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the fields on Banking and Banking Details screen are populated basis the logic defined in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|smart-link], then SFDC should provide the user with a “Reset” button on the UI.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user clicks on the “Reset” button, then user should be shown the Pop-Up as mentioned in the description.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when user clicks on the “Yes” button from the Pop-Up user should be redirected to the Perfios Screen showing the Cards.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when user lands on the Perfios Screen, then user should be able to proceed as per the expected process by clicking on the available cards.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when user selects a new bank name from the available options, then SFDC should be able to save the details by creating a new banking record in the object “Perfios Bank Details”.

*Proposed:* In continuation to [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|smart-link] if the response from API 3 is not received successfully, then the fields on Banking Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|smart-link] and Banking Details Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|smart-link] will not be populated and will remain blank.

In such scenarios, a “Retry” button to be available for the user on the UI in place of “View” button.

!image-20240217-142715.png|width=719,height=113!

In such cases, on the Banking Screen user should be shown a toast message stating “Perfios Response Failed, Please click ""Retry"" to attempt again. You have <N> attempts remaining.” In this “N” should be kept as a variable field and will get updated with every click as per the sequence mentioned below:

Before 1st click, the toast message should show - “Perfios Response Failed, Please click ""Retry"" to attempt again. You have 3 attempts remaining.”

Before 2nd click, the toast message should show - “Perfios Response Failed, Please click ""Retry"" to attempt again. You have 2 attempts remaining.”

Before 3rd click, the toast message should show - “Perfios Response Failed, Please click ""Retry"" to attempt again. You have 1 attempts remaining.”

Upon clicking this “Retry” button, API 3 to be called [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|smart-link] and the response received from API 3 will be used to stamp the fields on Banking Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|smart-link] and Banking Details Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|smart-link] respectively basis the logic mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-26000|smart-link].

User should be provided with 3 attempts to click the “Retry” button for recalling API 3 [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|smart-link]. In case API 3 does not responds successfully after the third attempt, then user should be allowed to proceed for next stage without completing the Perfios stage {color:#bf2600}by clicking “Next” button on the UI. This “Next” button should be enabled only when user has completed checking API 3 status for all applicants.{color}

{color:#bf2600}In case of multiple applicants, when API 3 responds successfully for one applicant and not for other applicant, then user should be allowed to proceed into next stage by clicking the “Next” button. {color}

Subsequently, the user should be shown a toast message informing the user of Perfios failure and to proceed without Perfios.","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when API 3 [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|smart-link] fails to respond successfully, then user should be provided with “Retry” button on the UI in place of “View” button as mentioned in the description.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user clicks on the “Retry” button, SFDC should be able to call API 3 [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|smart-link].
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when API 3 fails to respond successfully, user should be provided with 3 attempts to click on the “Retry” button for successfully calling API 3.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when user completes 3 attempts of clicking the “Retry” button and if API 3 still not responds successfully, then SFDC should allow user to proceed into next stage while showing the toast message as mentioned in the description.

*Proposed:* Creation of two category screens namely “Credit and Debit Entries” & “Balance” screens respectively within the banking details screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|smart-link].

In continuation to [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|smart-link] the two category screens should appear within the second section of banking details screen when the user clicks on “view” button from the banking screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|smart-link].

+In the first category screens i.e., Credit and Debit Entries screen following fields to be visible:+

* No. of credit entries
* No. of debit entries
* Total entries
* Total credit current month
* {color:#bf2600}Total credit XX month prior (Here XX month is the period derived basis the logic defined in {color}[https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24859|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24859|smart-link]{color:#bf2600}).{color}
** {color:#bf2600}For example, if XX value is determined to be 3, then the fields to be added as “Total Credit One Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Two Month Prior” and “Total Credit Three Month Prior” respectively.{color}
** {color:#bf2600}For example, if XX value is determined to be 6, then the fields to be added as “Total Credit One Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Two Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Three Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Four Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Five Month Prior” and “Total Credit Six Month Prior” respectively.{color}
** {color:#bf2600}For example, if XX value is determined to be 12, then the fields to be added as “Total Credit One Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Two Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Three Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Four Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Five Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Six Month Prior” till “Total Credit Twelve Month Prior”.{color}
** {color:#bf2600}For example, if XX value is determined to be {color}{color:#bf2600}-12-{color}{color:#bf2600} 18, then the fields to be added as “Total Credit One Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Two Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Three Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Four Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Five Month Prior” ; “Total Credit Six Month Prior” till “Total Credit Eighteen Month Prior”.{color}
* Average Quarterly Balance

+In the second category screens i.e., Balance screen following fields to be visible:+

* Minimum Balance
* Maximum Balance

Both these category screens should be available one after the other as shown in the below screenshot.

UI/UX for this screen should be same as per the snapshot shown below:

!24 (cfc23da2-1e0c-45e1-9a14-6ebf19a9ff19).jpg|width=940,height=457!

The screen should have a “Close” button placed at the bottom right corner on clicking which the Banking Details Screen along with the section and category screen should collapse and user should be able to view the Banking Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|smart-link].","# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user lands on banking details screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|smart-link] then the screen should also show the two categories namely, credit and debit entries & balance respectively.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user lands on the banking details screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25994|smart-link] then the two category screen should have the fields as mentioned in the above description.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user lands on banking details screen the UI/UX of both the categories should be as per the screenshot provided in the description.
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user clicks the “Close” button on the UI, the Banking Details Screen should collapse and user should only be able to see the Banking Screen [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25714|smart-link].
# {color:#bf2600}Given that mentioned changes are done, when the user lands on this screen, then basis the XX value derived, SFDC should be able to add Total Credit XX Month prior field as mentioned in the description.{color}","Lwc:

Continuation from [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|smart-link] 

*Proposed* 

When the date range doesn't cover range of the period and Submit to Perfios is disabled, to move forward with the case, user can upload additional document as mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25588|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25588|smart-link] ,  API 2 will be triggered again and Perfios will share a new response for new document uploaded

In continuation to [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|smart-link] if the user uploads another document then API 2 will be triggered and a new response will be received with transaction start date and end date in API 2 call. SFDC will stamp the dates in bank document detail record corresponding to the new document uploaded as mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|smart-link] 

The logic will work whenever new document is uploaded 

*Logic to update date range*

SFDC will compare the new values -  Transaction End Date and Transaction Start Date respectively received with value present in  Date range 

If value of transaction start date is earlier than start date in Date range , then start date in Date range will be updated with new value, else same value will be retained as start date in Date range

If value of transaction end date is recent than end date in Date range , then end date in Date range will be updated with new value, else same value will be retained as end date in Date range

Latest date range should be stamped on UI and back end as soon as the transaction start and end date is stamped for second or further documents

*Example:*

# If the date range  from initial document uploaded is identified as 25-Jan-24 - 22-Feb-24 and the revised  transaction start date and end date from additional document uploaded is identified as 28-Dec-23 - 10 Mar-24, then revised *date range* to be saved as  i.e., 28-Dec 23 - 10-Mar-24.
# If the date range  from initial document uploaded is identified as 25-Jan-24 - 22-Feb-24 and the revised transaction start date and end date from additional document uploaded is identified as 30 Jan 24 - 10 Mar 24, then revised *date range* to be saved as  i.e., 25-Jan-24 - 10-Mar 24.
# If the date range  from initial document uploaded is identified as 25-Jan-24 - 22-Feb-24 and the revised  transaction start date and end date from additional document uploaded is identified as 5 Jan 24 - 10 Feb 24, then revised *date range* to be saved i.e., 5-Jan-24 - 22-Feb-24.

Date range would be one unique value stamped under the field Date Range on UI, whether 1 or multiple documents are uploaded 

Logic to enable Submit to Perfios will run as soon as the updated date range is stamped  as per the [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|smart-link] ","# Given that Submit to Perfios is not enabled, when user uploads 2nd or further more documents , then date range should get updated on UI and back end as per the logic described
# Given that Submit to Perfios is not enabled, when user uploads another documents , then  transaction start and end date should get corresponding to the uploaded document in the back end in bank document detail record
# Given that Submit to Perfios is not enabled, when user uploads 2nd or further more documents , then Submit to Perfios should get enabled only when the logic to enable it is met as per [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-25553|smart-link] 
# Given that date range doesnt meet the critieria to enable submit to perfios button, then user should be forced to upload necessary documents and then only submit to Perfios should get enabled for clicking
# Given Submit to perfios is enabled, then user should be able to click on it and API 3 should get triggered [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24523|smart-link] ","Apex Class:

*Process Overview:*

SFDC identifies the number of months banking account statements to be obtained as XX value which is  obtained as per the logic mentioned in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24859|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-24859|smart-link] .

Post obtaining the XX value, SFDC to identify the LAN creation date and basis that it will ascertain the month and year to be sent in mentioned tags 

*Logic:*

If LAN creation date is in  within 15^th^ of the month and -current-  {color:#bf2600}the {color}month is N then bank account statement to be considered for analysis should be from period (N-2)-(XX-1) to  N-2 

If the LAN creation date is more than 15^th^ of the month and -current- {color:#bf2600}the{color} month is N  then bank account statement to be considered for analysis should be from period (N-1)-(XX-1) to (N-1) 

The logic should auto adjust basis the year , examples given below 

{color:#bf2600}Logic to check compare LAN creation date within N days of the month should be configurable at BU level .

*Example:*

If LAN creation date is 05-Jan-24 and XX value is 3, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Sep-23 to Nov-23.

If LAN creation date is 25-Jan-24 and XX value is 3, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Oct-23 to Dec-23.

If LAN creation date is 05-Mar-24 and XX value is 3, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Nov-23 to Jan-24.

If LAN creation date is 25-Mar-24 and XX value is 3, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Dec-23 to Feb-24.

If LAN creation date is 05-Jan-24 and XX value is 6, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Jun-23 to Nov-23.

If LAN creation date is 25-Jan-24 and XX value is 6, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Jul-23 to Dec-23.

If LAN creation date is 05-Mar-24 and XX value is 6, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Aug-23 to Jan-24.

If LAN creation date is 25-Mar-24 and XX value is 6, then bank account statement to be taken for the period Sep-23 to Feb-24.

Rural org is sending OTP SMS from NON-OTP channel as this consider as normal SMS, hence the delay.

Additional tag is required to be added in SVC - SENDSMS. Please refer document to perform the post deployment steps

L1 was inserting 1.2 Lakh records at the beginning of the Nov month through salesforce inspector. While uploading the records after a certain point (after inserting 60K records) SFDC limits are being hit and there is an exception thrown as ‘DML limit of 10001 records’.

*Current implementation* 

For PAN India telecaller user, On upload of offers, each offer is being shared with every Active PAN India telecaller user individually. The sharing is done through a trigger that runs on insert of the offer record in the system. If there are 10 PAN India telecallers and 100 Offers are being uploaded, there will be 1000 Offer share records inserted in the system.

*Proposed Implementation -* 

# All the PAN India telecallers will be grouped in one group - PANIndiaTelecaller-Bank/PANIndiaTelecaller-IFBL . 
# Any new user added to the system will/should be added to the new group - PANIndiaTelecaller.
# On load of a new offer, it will be shared with the new group. The offer will be visible to all the members who are added to the group.
# This will be a backend technical change, no changes will be done on the UI.

 Note - With this change L1 can continue to upload the Offers as is the process currently with batch size of 2000.","# Given that offers are uploaded on SFDC, when offers sharing starts, then it should happen with one group which is created, All the users will be mapped to new group as per description
# Given that n number of offers are ready for upload , when L1 uploads offers then all offers should get inserted and error should not come as mentioned in Problem statement. For example Should work when 5 Lac offers are uploaded in one go with batch size of 2000
# Given that mentioned changes are done, when offer is uploaded and shared with Tele caller group, then offer sharing should happen successfully with TC users and E2E functionality of TC and IRO assisted plus journey , drop off functionality  of TC and IRO , Offer sharing with IRO should work as it is,","Apex Classes:

Logic 1

SFDC will identify the Hierarchy basis the ROI and or PF Deviation selected on UI , and records maintained in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-22169|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-22169|smart-link] , Hierarchy would be one in which ROI Deviation and/or PF Deviation  maintained at sub record level = ROI Deviation and or PF Deviation selected on UI {color:#bf2600}by the front end user and  the BU and Workflow at subrecord level = LAN BU and  LAN Workflow and the main record is Active= True{color}

Logic 2

SFDC will compare hierarchies at record level identified in Logic 1 , the value which is having higher/equal will become the final hierarchy for the case. Please note L4>L3>L2>L1 ( from hierarchy perspective) . If no selection is made in any one of the ROI Deviation, PF Deviation field, then hierarchy will be decided basis the field selected by the user

For example : if ROI Deviation is selected as 1, and PF Deviation is not selected, then hierarchy will be identified basis 1 as L2 and it will become the final hierarchy as no value selected in PF Deviation

An example below 

|ROI Deviation|Hierarchy|PF Deviation|Hierarchy|*Final Approving Authority*|

SFDC will then run logic to identify approving authority from the master  maintained in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-22173|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-22173|smart-link] .  SFDC will identify the record from this master where LAN Location  = Master Record with Same location and same hierarchy as identified in Logic 2.

A pop up message should appear on top of the screen on manual selection of new CRN by the user 

*Assigning new CRN will lead to cancellation of the case.* 

If the user ignores above message and still continues with new CRN selection on UI and  clicks on +_Assign Selected CRN_+, following message should appear on UI as an informative message and stage/substage of the case should get updated to Cancel/Auto-Cancelled Respectively 

*New CRN has been selected for existing customer. Please re-login the case and retain old CRN at Verification stage*

Above such cases where new CRN is assigned manually by IRO, verification cases corresponding to these cases will be removed from IRO/UW verification queues and should not be visible thereafter

The new CRN selected by the user should not be updated at existing applicant /account level. Loan application/Applicant should -tagged to the new CRN and Account as selected by the user-  remain tagged to the Posidex Suggested CRN. -Cancelled case will be tagged to CRN selected by the USER.

-Approve/Reject UI/UX to appear as below-

-On click of Approve/Reject, approving authority should be able to enter comments. Entering the comments for approving authority will not be mandatory.- 

-On Click of Approve/Reject, event should get captured on SFDC. Further logics will be covered in separate story- [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-22231|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-22231|smart-link] 

*-Approach 1-*

-On click of Approve/Reject, the following email reply should get autogenerated for the user, the email will be directed to SFDC as per below format from approving authority. User should be able to enter comments in the email. User should be able to send email to SFDC.- 

_Dev team can explore another approach to collect approve/reject reason from approving authority and back communicate it to SFDC_

*Approach*

{color:#bf2600}Dev team has suggested following approach which is technically feasible after completing their analysis{color}

# {color:#bf2600}Trigger of mail to Approver mail box with format described{color}
# {color:#bf2600}Approver replies back on same mail with key words in the first line and comment in the second line{color}
# {color:#bf2600}SFDC reads the first line and second line of revert to check for Approval and Comments{color}
# {color:#bf2600}SFDC runs subsequent logics basis point 3{color}
# {color:#bf2600}if the delegate user field is updated at user level with valid mail ID, then SFDC will send the mail to delegate approver as well. Approver or Delegate Approver both will be able to approve the deviation on first come first serve basis. Name of Final Approver will be saved on ROI_PF Approved By maintained in loan application object {color}
{color:#bf2600}Delegate user field is optional. If there is no user added in the delegate user field, then only the approver to whom mail is triggered can Approve/Reject.{color}

*Current* : 

*MEL Plus* : Loan gets created on incorrect base loan due to incorrect mention of existing LAN/Parent Loan ID in Associated Offer. This is due to incorrect offer created details uploaded by BIU/Product team on SFDC . This leads to cloning of older data in Plus journey which happens from incorrect base loan, and also resulting in failure of FCRB logic

*MEL- PL Repeat* : User creates MEL Repeat journey on incorrect Account leading to creation of Repeat Journey on Incorrect Base loan

*Proposed*

+MEL Plus+ :  SFDC should not refer the base loan from the Existing LAN or Parent Loan ID in Associated Offer. Instead of it, SFDC should query and identify the most recent disbursed loan from MEL {color:#bf2600}basis CRN {color}mentioned in the Associated offer, SFDC will query the CRN and identify the most recent disbursed loan and use that LAN as Base loan for MEL Plus Journey and stamp in *Base Loan Application* field

*Proposed* :

Previous loan details to be subdivided into two sections. Subsections should be clearly visible to the User 

First Section *LMS details* will have following fields and two New buttons - Fetch Details, Save

+Fetch Details+ , UI/UX as per attachment

On click of Fetch Details , two logics will run- 

# API should be triggered [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19024|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-19024|smart-link] 
# below fields should get auto populated on front end on UI basis below logic

|Total Income of previous loan|SFDC Base loan|
|Cycle Number|SFDC Contact|
|Application ID of Previous LAN|SFDC Base loan|
|% of Incremental cash flow|Calculated in SFDC, no change to existing logic|

+When API is triggered+

Spinner should loan on the screen from the moment API is triggered and till the time API is responded, when spinner is loading , user should not be able to take any action on UI

Spinner should stop loading on the screen as soon as API responds , and user will be again directed to same screen, same page view

If success response received from API, API Response to be consumed and processed to extract values derived from tags received in response .  Below Field values will be auto-populated on UI as per existing format of below UI fields.

|EMIs Paid|""NO_OF_PAID_EMI""|
|Principal Outstanding|""PRINCIPAL_OUTSTANDING""|

Spinner should stop loading if the API is stuck in progress for more than 1 minute, Values will remain blank on UI for above mentioned values.

If error is received from the API , above mentioned 5 fields will remain blank on UI. user would have an option to enter the data manually as per current flow. User should be able to manually enter value in those fields where data didn’t auto populate

If no value is received in any one or multiple tag corresponding to above  mentioned 5 fields from LMS API response, SFDC should not store the value for that field on UI. It will remain blank. User should be able to manually enter value in those fields where data didn’t auto populate.

+Save+ , UI/UX as per attachment

Clicking on Save button will let storing of values in above mentioned 5 UI fields.  If the user has manually entered or updated values in any of the above mentioned 5 field,  Clicking on Save should not be allowed and user should get a validation until user uploads mandatory supporting document. User should get a validation on top of the screen as “*Please upload supporting document before saving the details”* . Once mandatory document is uploaded, user should be allowed to Click Save . On click of Save , values should get saved corresponding to above mentioned 5 fields on SFDC.

Creation of a document type and Name  - Statement of Account . The document should become mandatory whenever the values are entered manually by the user for above mentioned 5 fields. User should be able to upload a document with mentioned document type and name in Documents tab by clicking “Add Document”. Upload functionality will work as per current build

Fields will appear in same sequence on UI as mentioned below.

*Existing* : Once CONFIRM button is clicked , case moves to Income details screen for DIY/TC Journey

*Proposed* : 

DEDUPE call to be integrated once personal details are confirmed by clicking on “Confirm” . The case should not move to Next screen of Income details as per current flow. Basis the decision of Posidex , following workflow will be applicable. _Dev to confirm if we have one common button to CONFIRM for APP/CO-APPs._ 

Once DEDUPE is triggered on backend , there would be intermediate screen created on which processing spinner will appear on UI  user should not be able to take any action on UI. Refer Image 1. [~accountid:5f4de98ed0884f004927c5d7] Pls add the image

!image-20231003-062658.png|width=1536,height=864!

As soon as the API has responded, intermediate API screen will be removed and following should happen

*Posidex Approve*

In case Posidex has approved the case , Posidex will inform SFDC in DEDUPE response tag “Loan Decision”= Approve and “Is Refer “ = N

In case Posidex has approved the case , UI screen will move to Income details tab as per current flow of DIY/TC Journey. If the case is moved back, by hovering over to Personal details,  Posidex should not be called again

*Posidex Reject* 

In case Posidex has rejected the case , Posidex will inform SFDC in DEDUPE response tag “Loan Decision” = Reject

On back end , drop off reason should be stamped as *Posidex Reject* , case stage, substage should get updated to Reject, Posidex Reject FinnOne API will be called as it is

On front end , a message should appear on UI as 

“The application has been rejected” in an intermediary screen. UI/UX of message should be same as one used for Drop off Message shown to customer/Telecaller _._

If the application has been rejected, it will be a hard stop for TC/DIY Journey. 

*Posidex Refer*

In case Posidex has referred the case , Posidex will inform SFDC in DEDUPE response tag “Loan Decision”= Approve and “Is Refer “ = Y. The case will be considered dropped off and drop off reason should stamp as *Posidex Refer* UI screen will show existing message related to movement of case to IRO  in an intermediary screen_._ the case should land on Stage- Posidex , Substage- Posidex Refer,

The case should move out from Telecaller Queue/Customer queue, and moved to respective Branch queue in existing worklist of Telecaller Dropped cases or MEL+ Customer Journey cases. IRO will move forward the case further. Movement of case to branch queue and visibility of cases to IRO logics will work as it is from Telecaller journey , refer a scenario when the case is dropped from Telecaller due to any existing drop off reason . _Existing queues can be used to move the case_

Once the IRO identifies the case in MEL+ Customer Journey cases Worklist/ Telecaller dropped off Worklist cases,  takes ownership logic will run as per  existing build and once IRO starts editing the case, response of Posidex should appear on IRO screen as per current build . Verification cases should be created as per current build. Existing build of MEL+ IRO assisted journey in case of Posidex Refer should work as it is. 

*Posidex Error*

In case of error response from DEDUPE, following UI message will appear on intermediary screen with 3 retry options. Refer Image 2. the case should land on Stage- Posidex , Substage- Posidex Error

!image-20231003-062611.png|width=1536,height=864!

If success response is received in any attempt of retry,  logics as mentioned above will work in case of Posidex Approve, Posidex Refer, Posidex Reject

If all the 3 retrys are failed and case will be dropped off and drop off reason should stamp as *Posidex Error* and the case should move out from Telecaller Queue/Customer queue, land to respective Branch queue in existing worklist of Telecaller Dropped cases or MEL+ Customer Journey cases. IRO will move forward the case further. Movement of case to branch queue and visibility of cases to IRO logics will work as it is from Telecaller journey , refer a scenario when the case is dropped from Telecaller due to any existing drop off reason . _Existing queues can be used to move the case_

Once the IRO takes ownership of the case as per existing build and edits the case, the case should land on Stage- Posidex , Substage- Posidex Error as per current build, error response of Posidex should appear on IRO screen as per current build . IRO should get retry options as per the current build. If success response received on IRO screen, user should be able to move forward the case and submit the case as per current functionality.

*Common functionality*

Once the case has been dropped due to any drop off reason from Telecaller/DIY , existing functionality of MEL+ IRO assisted journey will work as it is unless specified differently in description

Drop off reason should not get updated to any other value in case of Posidex Refer/Posidex Reject / Posidex Error even after 24 hours inactivity threshold has been met . If the 24hours has not expired, User if tries to access the case/edit the case after screen was closed and then same screen where TC/DIY user left the journey should be shown on front end UI

In case of hard refresh on intermediate screen, Case will land on same screen . Posidex should not get called again

*Current* : We have rule engine logic to check for Mandatory documents to be uploaded before FinnOne submission and document upload screen for cases in MEL-PL [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-13486|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-13486|smart-link] and [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-13489|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-13489|smart-link] . We want to extend the solution to SBD cases in case of Gold Loans

*Proposed* : 

*Rule Engine*

Refer below table for list of documents and the respective scenario when the document should be mandatory

|*Document*|*Document Type*|*Document Name*|*Scenario*|
|Physical SI|SI DIRECT DEBIT MANDATE FORM|SI DIRECT DEBIT MANDATE FORM_NON-ADB|This document should get mandatory if user has opted for Physical SI for IDFC Bank Account provided for disbursement account in Latest Bank Details object record with Type= Main Bank.|
|NACH|NACH|NACH_NON-ADB|**Condition only to work for cases which are not open ECS only**
This document should get mandatory if user has opted for Physical Mandate/E mandate process for a Non-IDFC Bank Account provided for disbursement account in Type= Main Bank.|
|Esign Documents|ESIGN DOCUMENT|ESIGN DOCUMENT_NON-ADB|If Esign is not successful|
|Estamp Documents|ESTAMP DOCUMENT|ESTAMP DOCUMENT_NON-ADB|If Estamp Status not equal to Successful/Not Eligible|



*Doc Upload screen*

On click of Submit button , existing logic to check for ADB/Non ADB work as is , if a case is ADB, case will get submitted to FinnOne as per current build

but when a case is non ADB, system will run additional logic to check mandatory documents which are to be uploaded before pushing the case to DV.

System will ask user to upload all mandatory documents in document upload screen . A doc upload screen to upload mandatory documents should appear on screen similar to built in MEL-PL BAU [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-13489|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-13489|smart-link] .

Unless all mandatory documents are not uploaded, case will not move ahead to DV screen and case will continue to remain on same screen of Esign, Esign pending. Reference toast message to be visible as “*Loan Application is Non ADB. Kindly upload mandatory documents*” when user clicks on Submit button and all mandatory documents are not uploaded

Once mandatory documents are uploaded, on click of Submit button, case will move ahead to DV screen and logics to move the case will work as per current build of Gold workflow","# Logics should work for both Normal and Renewal journey flow. SFDC should check mandatory documents for a particular case whether it is normal or renewal flow
# Documents should become mandatory to be uploaded as per scenarios
# System is running existing checks of ADB/Non ADB on Click of Submit button on Esign/Esign Pending
# WHEN Loan is *ADB*, then- ADB Flag on Loan Application is getting checked and case is getting submitted to FinnOne as per current build
# when Loan is *Non ADB*, then- ADB Flag field on Loan Application remains unchecked 
# When the case is *Non ADB* as per  User should be able to see a section below Esign section. *This section should be similar to Document Upload screen. Reference screenshot below.* User will be shown list of document records one below other. User will be able to see below column headers. Document Type, Document Name, OSV, Uploaded Date, Is Uploaded, Upload.

# Documents to be shown in same sequence as mentioned in Rule Engine table
# The DMS ID is getting stamped in backend for the uploaded document
# In document upload section-document type and name should be as mentioned in description
# The system generated documents as per existing functionality should be available on Filenet
# WHEN Loan is *Non ADB*, then- SFDC is running the mandatory document logic to identify documents which should be mandatory
# *Document Mandatory Logic-*
The document should be mandatory for the user to upload on this section based on the Rule engine .User will be shown *asterisk* for the documents which are mandatory post running the RULE ENGINE.
# Document upload screen should be same as available in UI of document upload screen on document upload stage. It should be segregated for App and Co-app as per current build on document upload stage. Functioning on UI would be same for upload , Toast Message etc. There will be only two differences a. Only mandatory documents to be shown in the new section b. OSV header to be disabled and not shown on UI as this is not valid here.
# Once user uploads document, *DMS* API will get called at backend to upload the document in FileNet against respective Doc Type. Once document is uploaded in FileNet, Document DMS ID will get populated on respective Document Record in SFDC as received in DMS API response. Functionality of DMS API to be as current build.
# System to check if all mandatory documents as per the Rule Engine on click of Submit as applicable on screen. If all mandatory documents are not uploaded, user will not be able to submit the loan to FinnOne. Reference toast message to be visible as “*Loan Application is Non ADB. Kindly upload mandatory documents*”.
# DMS Document ID should be available for each of the *mandatory* document. If document is uploaded but DMS ID is not available on Document record, show validation- ""*Kindly retry Document upload.*""
# Once all the validations are met, user will be able to submit the case by clicking on SUBMIT and case will move to DV screen. If any of the validations is/are not met, user should not be allowed to submit the loan to FinnOne and toast msg should appear as *Loan Application is Non ADB. Kindly upload mandatory documents*
# Document size and type restrictions should work as per MEL/PL
# Apart from changes described, rest of the functionality of ADB/NON-ADB remains as it is
# Functionality to be tested with Mobile","DocumentGenerationScreen (Cmp)

*Current* : Underwriting level is maintained at user level for a UW user and Lending limit maintained in Global Master data list for a particular UW level at BU level is the CAD limit for a UW user

!image-20230829-065922.png|width=359,height=100!

*Proposed* : 

* Existing logics to read the {color:#bf2600}Underwriting level from field in snap and Lending Limit being referred from CAD Limit master {color}to be removed. SFDC should not decide the underwriting level using the existing field maintained at User level and lending limit using values maintained in the master global data lists
* Below fields should be hidden from Page layout and should not be visible to the user  

!image-20230829-065922.png|width=359,height=100!

* Underwriting Level and Lending Limit for a particular user will be decided basis the field values created in [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-20741|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-20741|smart-link] . 
* For example : If Parth Parwal user has field values for MEL Bank Underwriting Level as L1 and for Lending Limit as 100000 , then for any case where Parth Parwal is the UW and Business Unit= MEL and Workflow = Bank, Underwriting Level and Lending Limit becomes L1 and  100000 respectively. Parth Parwal should be able to approve the loan amount or approve the deviation given that he is mapped to Business Unit , Workflow , Branch and Location at user level. Case sharing logics will remain as per the current build
* {color:#bf2600}Mapping logic for deviations approval/ Approve/Soft Approve  should work as is per the current build only change would be that SFDC will refer new fields for Underwriting Level and Lending Limit instead of earlier field and values maintained at the master level.{color}
* If a value is blank in the fields ( [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-20741|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-20741|smart-link] ) corresponding to any user, user should not be able to take any action on front end given that case is shared as per case sharing logics with the UW user. For example 

# if a Lending Limit is not set for the user for a given workflow and Business unit and it is blank at User level  ,  User should not be able to “ Approve” , “ Soft Approve “ , error validation should appear on UI  ([~accountid:626240696cb53d006a6ab5a4] _Dev to confirm if Existing Validation can be used or a new validation message is needed, connect with DJO/Credit for new validation message content_)
# if Underwriting Level is not set for the user for a given workflow and Business unit and it is blank at User level ,  User should not be approve the deviation on front end, edit access will not be available to the user for Approving the deviation ","# To function as described
# Should work for UW cases in MEL-PL-HL-LAP BUs as described

Story,ML-20134,MEL & PL BAU,,Creation of New Object to handle DOA ,20-01-2024 15:52,Parth Parwal,08-08-2023 16:28,Dibyaraj Bharati,Dropped,,Medium,,ML-20066,,,,,ML-20066,,,,"*Applicable* : All UW Profiles - Branch Credit Manager, Cluster Credit Manager, State Credit Manager, National Credit manager.

*Proposed* : Create a new object which will be used to configure Lending limit and deviation level at user level for UW users ( Object would be similar to PL Enterprise Master)

Records will be created at user level and following fields should appear in each record created in the object

* User name ( look up value from existing user id detail)
* Business Unit
* Workflow
* Lending Limit
* Underwriting Level
* Is Active 

Once a new user is onboarded with profile-Branch Credit Manager, Cluster Credit Manager, State Credit Manager, National Credit manager, 8 new records should get created for that particular user in the object automatically. 

Each record will be created with below details

User Name, Business Unit, Workflow

Example 

Parth Parwal, MEL, Bank

Parth Parwal, MEL, IFBL

Parth Parwal, PL, Bank

Parth Parwal, PL, IFBL

Parth Parwal, HL, Bank

Parth Parwal, HL, IFBL

Parth Parwal, LAP, Bank

Parth Parwal, LAP, IFBL

L1 user should be able to update Lending limit, Underwriting Level and Is Active using import of excel file using data loader in one go. 

SFDC will allow only 1 unique record creation with below combination of values. 

*Combination* : User Name, Business Unit, Workflow

Duplicate records should not be allowed to be created. While importing records using excel file, during addition of new records or updating of existing records , duplicate records should not be allowed to inserted on SFDC.

L1 users should be able to add new records on the Object using import of excel file using data loader. All the fields in the records should get updated as per excel file- User name, Business Unit, Workflow, Lending Limit, Underwriting Level,  Is Active.

L1 users should be able to update existing records at Object using import of excel file using data loader . All the fields in the records should get updated as per excel file - User name, Business Unit, Workflow, Lending Limit,  Underwriting Level , Is Active

L1 users should be able to delete existing records at Object using import of excel file in one go. Entire Record should get deleted

Record with incorrect user name (which is not an existing user with UW Profiles Branch Credit Manager, Cluster Credit Manager, State Credit Manager, National Credit manager ) should not be allowed to be inserted in the object

Existing logics of Lending Limit and Underwriting level to be removed.  SFDC should not decide the underwriting level using the field maintained at Profile level. 

Lending Limit and Underwriting level should be derived basis the values maintained in the Object SFDC should decide Lending Limit and Underwriting level using the user name, Business Unit and Workflow maintained in the new object 

*Deviation Approval >> Deviations approval authority*

Deviation approval : User Dropdown should show all usernames mapped for the product under the respective deviation level basis the records maintained in Object level. Bank user should view list of users mapped in Bank workflow. IFBL user should view list of users mapped in IFBL workflow. If the IFBL case is recommended to Bank user , list of all Bank users should be viewable while closing the deviation.  Functionality should work as is only the difference would be list of users should be decided basis the records created at Object level

!image-20230829-072552.png|width=1275,height=375!

*Loan Amount entered at UW stage >> Decision = ""Approve"",""Soft Approve""*

While taking Approve, Soft Approve decision, lending limit should be checked basis the values maintained in the records at Object level for User name basis the Business Unit and Workflow . Error msg should come as is 

When case is forwarded, list of users in “Forward to” should be basis the records maintained in the object level at user level for the said Business Unit and Workflow ( Functionality should work as is , only difference is logics should run basis the records maintained in object )

When case is recommended, list of users in “Recommend to”  should be basis the records maintained in the object level at user level for the said Business Unit and Workflow ( Functionality should work as is , only difference is logics should run basis the records maintained in object )

User should be able to view the underwriting level and Deviation level mapped when he logs in

!image-20230829-074314.png|width=1010,height=430!

Audit trail should be maintained for each record available in the object

A new report type should be created where all the records present in the object should get extracted in a tabular format

If Lending limit and/or Underwriting level is not maintained against the business unit and workflow for any user with Mentioned profiles,, then UW user will get a validation message “Lending Limit and Underwriting Level is not set for the user, please connect with Process Team”  and should not be able to take ‘Soft Approve’ and ‘Approve’ decision like it is available currently.

Values maintained in below fields to be made blank for all the users with profiles mentioned in lower environment and Production environment

# For all PL Loan Applications, SFDC needs to maintain a cycle count. A customer with PL Loans, PL+ Loans, PL Repeat Loans would have a count maintained on contact level as per current MEL implementation. 
# A new field to be created at Contact/Person Account to capture the current count of all PL loans. Field Label- *PL loans count*
# For each disbursed PL Loan, the counter will be increased by 1. Example illustration below-
## If the Customer has initially taken *PL* Loan first time, then the count of that loan would be “1” at contact/person account
### PL count to be maintained at the current disbursed loans on org. To be kept at 1
## When the customer comes again and is eligible for *PL Repeat* the count of the loan becomes “2” at contact/person account
## And if the same customer revisit for *PL+* loan, the count of that loan becomes “3” at contact/person account
## And so on.
## No specific sequence for PL Repeat and PL + to be hardcoded.
# Hence, for all 3 variant of PL – PL/PL+/PL Repeat, the count should be stamped at back-end on contact/person account
# The Count is valid for only Disbursed loans. PL/ PL repeat /PL + cases which are not disbursed/are WIP should not be included in the counting.","# Cycle count field *PL loans count* is visible on Loan Contact
# Count is maintained based on the latest disbursed loan application

# Once the first loan of the customer is disbursed, the field value is getting updated from 0 to 1 on contact 
# if new loan application is created and disbursed for a Coapp added in any existing disbursed loan application, count of loan is not getting updated on previous loan primary applicant contact
# no impact on count due to FCRB, i.e. if customer’s previous loan is foreclosed

Second Validation

* Appointee age should be more than 18 years , if the user proceeds with a case with appointee less than 18 years, error should appear on screen as “ Appointee can’t be less than 18 years old, Please check the Date of Birth of Appointee”

Case should not be allowed to proceed if the conditions are not met as mentioned above

Handling the Composite APIs in Rural Org

*Use Case:*

# Handling the Composite APIs in Rural Org.
# Applicable for all Business Units - Rural HL, Rural LAP, Rural MEL, Rural PL, Rural Gold Loan
# Applicable for all composite APIs.

*Details:* 

# Currently, the composite APIs created from Org 3 BUs, are being stored in both “contentdocument” and “attachment” object of service call. 
# This will lead to content size limit issue in future.
# To handle this, SFDC Org3 needs to store the API attachment in “attachement” object only.
# The same should not stored in “contentdocument” object.
# This change will be applicable for new Loans created after deployment of this CR. Existing loans where these services are already initiated, it will be handled through IT activities.



*Applicable APIs:*

# KARZA_AADHAR_MASKING_ATTACH - Request is stored in Attachment and Files
# DMS Request API - Request is stored in Attachment and Files both.
# CBS_SigandPhoto - Request is stored in Attachment and Files both.
# KARZA_OCR_KYC - Request is stored in Attachment and Files both.
# EMAIL_COMMUNICATION - Request is stored in Attachment and Files both.","# Checking the storage limit in backend
# above mentioned Composite API created/ initiated from Org3 to be stored in “attachment” object instead of “contentdocument” object. 
# Below API should be stored in Attachment

# MatchDetails - Response is stored in Attachment.

It is required to analyze the places where this ROI is currently getting calculated. This calculation is happening at JS level (UI level) in current implementation.



So to simplify this process, the approach would be to redesign the ROI calculation and stamping using one common Apex from the 

# Applicant Entry Next stage, and 
#  If BCM changes Loan amount or scheme, where RoI is supposed to be re-calculated.
# If IRO changes the loan amount or scheme,  RoI is supposed to be re-calculated.

The logic for ROI stamping should happen as per the policy grid.

this logic is in place but is at js level and too complex to debug and fix.

This needs to be simplified using apex controller , for setting the ROI and stamping at backend and UI.

Also would need to analyze and understand if by any other means ROI could be updated in a loan.

*Description:*","# ROI value should be same as per the scheme ROI maintained in Custom Metadata
# Once user lands on Applicant details screen and captures Requested loan amount, then on click of Next button, the ROI should get stamped on Loan Asset as per the Custom Metadata (custom metadata to be referred- configuration settings)
# On Change of Loan Amount or Scheme by IRO on Loan Details screen, the RoI should get restamped on the Loan Asset as per the Custom Metadata (custom metadata to be referred- configuration settings)
# On Change of Loan Amount or Scheme by BCM on Underwriting, the RoI should get restamped on the Loan Asset as per the Custom Metadata (custom metadata to be referred- configuration settings)
# The same ROI entered on front end and stamped on Loan asset ROI field is stamped on Loan Asset is flowing in FinnOne submit request.
# Scenario on ROI population on Loan Asset to be tested for-

*Description* - 

1.) Unable to use MATM tab for cash withdrawals 

2.) Add tags for sending multiple identifiers for accounts opened through Salesforce.

3.) As per the current implementation, in the request structure, we can't send Multiple identifiers to CBS. If the user has PAN and aadhar then only one of the identifiers can be sent.

4.) The user is unable to use withdraw option through the MATM tab. The aadhaar number is showing blank.  This is because the customer account profile Aadhar is not mapped in CBS. Only the Pan number is updated in CBS as per KYC. Cash withdrawal transactions are getting rejected if Aadhar is not mapped against the customer during verification of profile with CBS.

5.) If the customer is not mapped with the Aadhar number in CBS then in such cases cash withdrawal through TAB will not get successful.

*Expected* -

1.) Add tags for sending multiple identifiers for accounts opened through Salesforce.

2.) For new customer creation, We will send 2 Identifier in the create customer API

3.) Currently we have only 1 Tag where either PAN or aadhar is send.

“idtfcn"": \{

                                                ""idNm1"": ""749891172815"",

                                                ""idTp1"": ""44"",

}

4.) as a change we are adding two more Tags where 2nd Identifier would be send.

5.) If PAN and aadhar would always be send in the request if same is present. If both the Identifier are not present on applicant object then any other identifier would be send present on the applicant object

*Tags* -                                       ""idtfcn"": \{

*Problem* - In a few cases, signatures and photos were not getting updated because of which customers were unable to withdraw funds. The primary reason was - Users were uploading pdf files.

*Solution -* For CKYC Photo and Signature proof documents only *JPEG and JPG* document types are allowed to be uploaded. If the user uploads any other document then an *error should be given to upload the correct format.* 

*Warning Message* - ""Upload max file size 4 MB. For Customer Photo upload max file size 1 MB. Supported formats: JPG,JPEG""

GETDOCUMENTSERVICE” API stuck in-progress when large response received from Filenet.

*Service:*
GETDOCUMENTSERVICE Attachment API

*Business Context*

# In SFDC, whenever any documents need to be viewed from FileNet to SFDC then it can be viewed from GETDOCUMENT SERVICE API.
# If there are 50+ documents which are present in Filenet then data present in GETDOUCMENT SERVICE API becomes much more than SFDC can consume/ handle. For very API request & Response Salesforce can consume character limit up to ~140000 characters. If more characters are sent from Mule then SFDC will not be able to accept the response and will revert with character limit exceeded error to Mule. GetDocument service API will remain in ""In Progress"".

*Proposed Process*

# To solve this problem, we need to create GETDOCUMENT SERVICE API in attachment form. With this SFDC will get response from Filenet in an attachment form and the response content will remain the same.

SVC Name - GETDOCUMENTSSERVICE_ATTACH

Request - \{ ""getDocuments"" : \{ ""filterBean"" : \[ \{ ""property"" : \[ \{ ""propertyValue"" : ""0379478204"", ""propertyName"" : ""CF_SFDCLoanNumber"" } ] } ], ""docClass"" : ""CF_LOANDOCUMENT"", ""arg2"" : """" } }

The response will be attachment response and SFDC needs to read the composite response

*_2.)_* To create a new batch that runs after the user is reactivated, If a user is deactivated via the batch and was reactivated again(isActive on the user is made to true), but the user does not log in even after reactivation. Then, the user should not be deactivated for a specific window period which should be configurable, post the completion of the window period user should be deactivated.

*_3.)_* To create a new batch if the manager gets deactivated.  If X user, has to be deactivated via batch, then we will need to assign Y as the escalation manager of Z.

For example - If Z is the user and his escalation manager is X and Y is the escalation manager of X. Now, X is deactivated then Y will be the escalation Manager of Z.

As a IRO, I should be able to view the customer documents on document upload screen and customer photo & signature should be flown to CBS, for MEL+ & MEL Repeat applications.

h3. Assumptions

h3. Use Case

# Applicable to ? MEL+ & MEL Repeat 
# Screens ? Document Upload screen & Disbursement screen ? Create new account flow ? CBS_SigandPhoto API
# Fetch document from FileNet

h3. Details

*Current Problem Statement*

# Currently, when an existing customer take a MEL+ or MEL Repeat loan then, SFDC fetches all the documents of that customer from its Base loan i.e. previous latest loan.
# But, SFDC also implemented [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10519|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-10519|smart-link] , where now SFDC is hard deleting documents of loan applications with below stages:
## Stage - Disbursed
## Stage - Reject
## Stage - Cancel
# This created blocker for MEL+ & Repeat journeys, as SFDC is not getting any documents from base loan for such MEL+ & Repeat customers. Hence, a different architecture level handling needs to be done.

*Expected*

# For new MEL+ or Repeat loans, where SFDC has deleted all the relevant the documents against their base loans, now SFDC needs to fetch those documents from FileNet.
# SFDC already has all the relevant SVC name & tags mapping of Filenet and same needs to be reused to get the documents for the new loans being created.
# Where to trigger this API & how to trigger it ? This call needs to be taken by the architect and needs to be added in comments.
# On new MEL+ & Repeat loans ? 
## Documents of base loan i.e. documents of that customer are to be shown on Document screen. 
## Customer Signature & photo is also sent to CBS on Disbursement screen ? Create new account flow ? CBS_SigandPhoto API","# For new MEL+ or Repeat loans, if the base loan documents are deleted then SFDC fetches all the relevant documents from Filenet and journey is not blocked due to same.

Debit Card API to trigger as per the toggle selection done for creating new account

h3. Use Case:

# Debit card toggle button visibility
# New T&C content to be displayed on New Account opening screen
# After Sanction -> Disbursement screen -> Create new account button
# If user opted for Debit Card, then this API trigger to happen

h3. Applicable to:

Org 3 all products - MEL(all products), PL, HL, LAP & Gold Loan

h3. Details:

*Debit Card - Toggle button on new account opening screen:*

* Refer screenshot attached for reference
* Currently while data entry i.e. before sanction, there is a toggle button on new account opening screen for all the projects as “Do you want cheque Book”. Similarly, now there should be 1 more toggle visible besides this toggle as “Do you want Debit Card”.
* This debit card toggle button will also have same logic as of Cheque book toggle i.e. if applicant is literate then only this  toggle will be visible on front end and debit card api will trigger only if user opts for the same.
** Debit card toggle will not be visible on front end at all, if applicant is illiterate. 
** Refer story for logic - [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-6400|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-6400|smart-link] 
** Field “Literate Type” is added for all the products ? Only for Primary Applicant ? on Employment screen under Personal Details
* The toggle button behavior should be same as cheque book toggle. This toggle should show default value as NO. User can toggle it to Yes, if they want to opt debit card.

----

*New T&C content to be displayed on new account opening screen, before/after sanction both:*

# When user selects New account opening flow, then when he lands on Before & After sanction -> New account opening screen new T&C content to be displayed at the bottom of screen as below:
# {{I/We state, declare, confirm and agree that the Bank has duly explained to me/us that IDFC Param/ Vishesh Asset linked Savings account (ALSA) will be converted to Vishesh Savings account where there is a requirement to maintain Average Monthly Balance (AMB) requirement of Rs 5,000/-. Charges basis latest schedule of charges hosted on bank website will be applicable if: -}}
{{a) Loan account not set-up within 3 (three) months of Asset Linked Savings Account opened (i.e. Param / Vishesh account) and/or}}
{{b) Loan account closed and no other Live Asset relationship with IDFC FIRST Bank}}
# There should a *checkbox* before the content as we have for the consents on disbursement screen.
# As taking consent is mandatory before performing any action, hence same ticking this checkbox is mandatory for user to enable the ‘Open Account’ button. Open account button should be disabled till user checks the consent.

----

*Debit card API trigger after sanction:*

* If user has marked the above new debit card toggle as YES & he lands on After sanction -> New account opening screen and clicks on ""Open Account"" button, then a Debit card API should be triggered.
* API Trigger to happen only in below flow:
** Create Customer 
** Create Account
** Cheque book API & Debit card API - If create customer & account is successful, then only cheque book & debit card APIs should get triggered. This logic is already there for cheque book api, same should be there for debit card.
** Refer flow screenshot attached for reference 
* This debit card api is a backend api i.e. SFDC triggers this at backend and no results are visible to customer on frontend.
* Debit card API details are in below document:

* Currently a pop up is displayed on the SFDC frontend when a Rejection is received from FICO (PFA Screenshot - Fico Error). This should instead *displayed in the component* along with a *Reject reason* as in case of POSIDEX (PFA of Screenshot - Posidex example_Error)
*  Need to implement when stage = *Reject*   & sub-stage = *Scorecard Reject*.
* SFDC needs to read tag *_""DeclineReason""_* and this is already being done and saved under field Loan Application Detail ? Stage ? “Error Message“. This same field should be visible on front end.

*_\[Please Note - The above POSIDEX screen shot is just for your reference. A similar implementation of error message has to be done for FICO after the Loan & Product screen]_*

*Current:*

# Currently, when existing Open ECS are found for a customer in a new loan application, all the existing ECS options are provided to the customer in the Open ECS Mandate drop-down, if the tenure and balance amount of loan application are valid.
## Existing implementation [https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-6091|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-6091|smart-link] 
## Here, system validates Open ECS mandate details (fetched from Finnone basis of customer’s CRN), wherein the ECS balance & tenure are compared with the loan details i.e. Loan amount & tenure.
## If the norms are met then application is considered as Open ECS, otherwise it is considered as Fresh ECS.
# In case of multiple repayment account options are fetched in existing ECS check Ex: HDFC and ICICI i.e. multiple accounts are fetched from FinnOne for that CRN, then all are displayed to the user on front end and its given to user to select one of the bank after customer’s consent.

*Expected:*

# In this story, 1 more validation/criteria needs to be introduced once the OPENECS API returns response and existing Open ECS Mandate are found linked with the CRN, from Finnone.
# Due Day Value will be received from the OPen ECS api response. 
# If the DueDay value matches value as stamped in the Due Day master for that Product and Workflow, the case will be eligible for OPen ECS and User can move ahead with OPen ECS
# If the DueDay value does not match the value as stamped in the Due Day master, then OPen ECs will not be eligible and user will go ahead with Fresh ECS

* The options in the Open ECS Mandate drop-down are to be populated only when these criteria are fullfilled for an ECS:-
*# Value in tag “DueDay” received in the OPENECS API response is to be compared with the value stamped in Acceptable Due Days in the Due day master for that Product and Workflow.
*# Other current running validation’s/criteria’s should remain as is of ECS balance & tenure

# Eligible for NACH Scan condition ? User Initiated NACH Scan on Document Generation Screen
# Timer for the NACH scan is ended and user is either performing esign or estamp
# *Physical NACH Status = In Progress or Response time exceeded* & User clicks on Check Status button from front end, below API 4 to trigger

*API Details:*

# On click of Check Status button, SFDC will check the value of Physical NACH Scan and Mandate ID on the bank detail record and update the fields on front end respectively.
# If the value of *Physical NACH Status = In Progress* *or Response time exceeded*
## An API, API_4 will be triggered to get the status directly from SFDC to Mule.
## The values of Physical NACH Status, Mandate ID, UMRN and Rejection Reason on bank detail object and Physical NACH Status and Mandate ID on front screen will be updated accordingly.
# Verification request via API_4, will be used to fetch the transaction status in single or bulk.
# If Mandate ID present for this Bank detail then same will flow under tag “TpslRegNo” otherwise mandate ID will not flow. Always, MerchantRequestNo will flow in this API.

# For HL & LAP on document generation stage no conditions are there and hence for HL & LAP cases will be submitted to DV Ops maker/checker as per current flow i.e. NACH scan status will not hamper moving ahead from document generation screen. User can submit the case to DV Ops.

h3. Use Case:

# Eligible for NACH Scan condition ? User Initiated NACH Scan on Document Generation Screen
# User has initiated NACH Scanning process and results are there or in progress
# User completes Esign/Estamp ? MRO submits case to DV by Ops
# DV Ops maker is completed ? Loan is under DV ops Checker ? Now clicking on FinnOne submit button as per below conditions

*Overall Condition:*

# 24hrs logic need to implement and this hrs should be kept configurable in SFDC. Currently keep it as 24 hrs.
# If any of the below condition is achieved then case can be submitted to Finnone by DV Ops Checker:
## Any status from below (Initiated/In Progress) & >=24 hrs, then case can move ahead +OR+
## Success status irrespective of hours, then case can move ahead
# Otherwise case cannot be submitted to FinnOne in any of the other combinations

*Details:*

As a DV Ops Checker, I want to be able to submit a case to FinnOne only when Physical NACH scan is successful and a Mandate ID has been received or case is stuck for more than 24 hours*(this time to be kept configurable on SFDC, it can be reduced or increased)*.

# When Loan is in ownership of DV Ops Checker and on click of Submit button at the bottom of the screen, post DV Ops maker completion, *SFDC to let the case get submitted to FinnOne if* :-
## Physical NACH Status = Initiated/ NPCI Final Approve/ Acknowledge/ TPSL Approve/ Final Approved/ TPSL Approved/ NPCI Acknowledged/ Final Approved AND Mandate ID is not blank
+*OR*+
## The time difference between system time when user clicks on Submit button and NACH Scan datetime field value stored in bank detail object +>= 24 hours+
# If the The value of Physical NACH Status = In Progress/Error/ Response time exceeded/ Deactivated /TPSL Initial Reject/ NPCI Final Reject NPCI Initial Reject/ Cancelled/ TPSL rejected/ Final rejected, then there are 2 conditions which needs to be considered as below:
## If the time difference between system time when user clicks on Submit button and NACH Scan datetime field value stored in bank detail object is +>= 24 hours+, then on click of Submit button by DV Ops Checker, *SFDC to let the case get submitted to FinnOne*
## If the time difference between system time when user clicks on Submit button and NACH Scan datetime field value stored in bank detail object is +< 24 hours+, then on click of Submit button by DV Ops Checker, *SFDC to NOT let the case get submitted to FinnOne.*
### A validation message should be displayed as ""Case can be submitted to FinnOne only after 24hrs of NACH Scan or If NACH is approved.“

*Batch to schedule:*

*A scheduled batch to run every 5 hours* (to be kept configurable), which will check if the time difference between when the batch was run and value in NACH Scan datetime field >= 24 hours.

# If time difference >= 24 hours, loan will be auto-submitted to FinnOne even if Mandate ID is not generated and Physical NACH Status =In Progress/ Error/ Response time exceeded/ Deactivated /TPSL Initial Reject/ NPCI Final Reject NPCI Initial Reject/ Cancelled/ TPSL rejected/ Final rejected.

User Story:

As a user, I should not be able to proceed ahead if the customer is having multiple live loans, as having only 1 active loan is allowed for a customer.

h3. Use Case:

# For MEL Repeat ? After BCM Sanction ? Insurance screen ? Next
# For MEL+ ? Insurance screen ?Next
# API ? FinnOne Submit API

h3. Details:

# Requirement is - A customer can have only 1 MEL and 1 MEL+ or repeat loan as an active loan and same needs to be maintained on SFDC.

!image-20210804-143154.png|width=710,height=484!



*Front end*

# Hence, for MEL+ & MEL Repeat cases on Post sanction Insurance Screen ? Next, if that customer is having more than 1 active loan then a hard stop will be there on this screen and user cannot proceed ahead the loan punching for that particular journey.
# If for the customer on CRN level there are multiple loan IDs which are having Live Loan as yes then there should be a hard stop at below stages:
## MEL+ journey ? Insurance screen ? Next
## MEL Repeat ? After BCM Sanction ? Insurance screen ? Next
## When user will click on Next for such cases, then a message should be displayed on the Insurance details as ""Customer has following active loans- abc, xyz. Xyz would be closed from system at the time of disbursal.Please close other loans manually before proceeding further. “
Where xyz is latest loan.
## With this message visible on screen, complete screen will become read only and user cannot Move ahead
## Hard stop on stage sub-stage ? Sanction - Insurance Pending
# If there are only 1 previous active loans including this loan, then above Message should not be visible to user on front end.
# Once, the previous active loans (other loans than current) are closed, then current loan should be proceed ahead when user opens the same and should be landed on Disbursement screen, to continue loan punching.

*Logic*

# This check should be applied only for MEL+ & MEL Repeat cases 
# To implement this hard stop, SFDC needs to check the loans taken for that customer (who is opting loan - Primary Applicant) i.e. check the CRN of that customer and check for all the loan IDs associated to it. 
# Here, products to be considered are - MEL (Except PM Swanidhi) , MEL+ & MEL Repeat disbursed loans.
# For the associated loan IDs check for the Live Loan check box, if more than 1 loan (previous/base loans) is having live loan count as yes - Excluding current punching loan, then current i.e. latest loan ID should not be allowed to proceed ahead of after sanction ? insurance screen.
# Here, if current loan along with one more previous loan is the live/active loan and all the previous loans are closed/inactive then same validation should not run and user can proceed ahead without any hard stop at insurance stage.

*MEL+ FinnOne Submit Logic Change*

# Currently, the base loan is sent to FinnOne on which the MEL+ offer was raised. This logic needs to be updated with - now when a MEL+ case will be submitted to FinnOne then “Latest disbursed active base loan” should be flown and not the base loan on which the offer was raised.
## FinnOne ID should be send to FinnOne in the tag - “TopupAggrementID”
# If no Active loan is present then topup flag should not be send to FinnOne (As currently implemented)
# This logic is currently working correct for a Repeat journey. Same should be updated for MEL+.","# For MEL+ & MEL Repeat cases on Insurance Screen ? Loan details pop-up if that customer is having more than 1 active loans Apart from this loan then a hard stop is there on this screen and user cannot proceed ahead the loan punching for that particular journey.
# This check is applied only for MEL+ & MEL Repeat cases.
# A pop up for such cases is visible with a message as “""Customer has following active loans- abc, xyz. Xyz would be closed from system at the time of disbursal.Please close other loans manually before proceeding further. “
Where xyz is latest loan.

h3. Details:

*Current:*

# Currently, If POI & POA is selected on applicant screen and is mandatory, then user has to upload the document for the identifier selected under POI & POA on Document screen, as a mandatory document.
# But, still there is a provision for user to add additional identifier on Applicant screen and no document upload is mandatory in such scenario.

*Expected:*

# If user has added any additional identifier other than the identifier which is selected under POI & POA then that identifier document upload will be mandatory for the user.
# e.g. If under POI ? user has selected Aadhar & under POA ? user has selected Passport. And added an Additional Identifier ? Voter ID, then whatever identifier user has added other than POI/POA identifier, that identifier document upload will become mandatory, means here Voter ID will become as a mandatory doc upload for user.
# The POI/POA doc upload - mandatory/non mandatory conditions/scenarios ? will remain as existing. No change in that.
# Here, now system is expected to read the other additional identifier added by user, excluding to what is selected under POI/POA.

*Document Upload Screen:*

# As per mentioned above, system will read the other additional identifier added by user, excluding to what is selected under POI/POA, and same should be visible to user on Document upload screen as a mandatory document to upload.
# As per given above example, here user will now see Voter ID as a separate record under Document screen table and will be visible as a mandatory doc upload. 
# This should work for all the additional identifiers added by the user on applicant screen.
# This should work for all - applicant, co-applicant & guarantor - for all the products.
# Document upload functionality should work as existing and no change in that. As existing, Aadhar masking should work on Aadhar uploaded if additional identifier added is Aadhar.

*Document Details:*

Below are the details for DMS callout -

All such additional identifier documents come under Document type:

Document Sub type should be used as per the identifier name selected:

# Voter ID
# Passport
# Aadhar card
# Driving license
# NREGA
# NPR","# System reads the other additional identifier added by user, excluding to what is selected under POI/POA, and same is visible to user on Document upload screen as a mandatory document to upload.
# This works for all the additional identifiers added by the user on applicant screen & for all - applicant, co-applicant & guarantor - for all the products.

User Story:

SFDC should read API 3 and take necessary action as per the response received.

h3. Prerequisite:

[https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-6079|https://fincap.atlassian.net/browse/ML-6079|smart-link] - both the APIs are completed and SFDC is waiting for API 3 now. But on front end user has proceed ahead of NACH Scan section.

h3. Use Case:

# Eligible for NACH Scan condition ? User Initiated NACH Scan on Document Generation Screen
# Timer for the NACH scan is ended and user is either performing esign or estamp

h3. Details

The basic objective of this API is to push the Status of the Mandate Registration from Ingenico to the Merchant server i.e. SFDC - its an Inbound API

*API 3 Details:*

# The response post Physical NACH Status is stamped as Initiated will be received to SFDC in an inbound S2S API via mule: API_3.
# This API is received from Ingenico to SFDC:
## S2S push is done to the Merchant for status of Mandate Registration
## S2S push will be done to the merchant server at End of Day as per the status in the Ingenico system
## S2S push will be done on the basis of Push instead of records. One Push may carry more than 1 records
# The API_3 will be inbound to SFDC more than 1 time.
# Each time API_3 is received in SFDC, the Physical NACH Status is to be updated in the bank detail object.
# The value of *MTSSerialNo* received in request of API_3 is to be compared with the value stored in *Mandate ID* in the bank detail record. The value for Physical NACH Status is to updated basis the MTSerialNo.

[^API 3.txt]

*If API 3 sends failure:*

# If the value in field Physical NACH Status = Error / Deactivated /TPSL Initial Reject/ NPCI Final Reject/ NPCI Initial Reject/ Cancelled; the user will have to initiate NACH OCR again.
# Once the response is received below to happen on front end:
## A notification to be shown on the top of the page, ”NACH Scan failed. Kindly retry.” and should also be visible under section “NACH Scan”
## Initiate NACH Scan button will get enabled i.e. the button will be enabled to user only in error
## Check Status Button will get Disabled
## Status will be visible to user on front end, as stamped on backend

*If API 3 sends success:*

# If the value in field Physical NACH Status = Initiated/ Final Approved/ TPSL Approved/ NPCI Acknowledged/ Final Approved; Check Status button will be +Enabled+ -disabled-.
# Once the response is received below to happen on front end:
## A notification to be shown on the top of the page, “NACH Scan successful\!” and should also be visible under section “NACH Scan”
## Buttons will remain disabled - Initiate NACH Scan -& Check Status-  
## Check Status button will remain enabled - *As user may want to get updated status*

*Back end handling:*

# Eligible for NACH Scan condition
# NACH Scan section visible on Document Generation Screen

h3. Condition for NACH Scan:

# When a loan application proceeds to Document Generation screen and all the documents are generated successfully, SFDC to check if the RegistrationOption = Physical and ECS Type = Fresh ECS, in the latest bank detail record created.
## If yes, user will be eligible to attempt Physical NACH Scan and the new section “NACH Scan” will be visible to user on front end.
### Loan will traverse through new stage - substage
## If no, the section: “NACH Scan“ will be bypassed and will not be visible to user on front end. 
### Loan will Not traverse through new stage - substage

This will be done by cloning UW profile.

Profile and stage checks need to be made configurable

List of profiles and stages need to be maintained ass per requirement, so that addition of a new stage also does not require any code changes

Below stages are considered currently:

Underwriting

Data Verification

We need to put additional stage checks for PDOC and disbursed stages as well

This is required for internal audit purpose, i.e. access of UW will be provided for auditing details of disbursed cases. Changing the profile of these audit users to Underwriter, would not work in Production, as the user would still get blocked during stage validation of “Disbursed” and other PDOC stages.

a. Here, as we did for Global data list, we have to do something for getPicklistValues(to fetch object specific picklist value), number of calls are increasing due to this.(*need discussion for better approach*)

b. If we resolve the first issue then we can minimize the redundant call of getPicklistValues, getFieldAccessibilities and getFieldValidations
